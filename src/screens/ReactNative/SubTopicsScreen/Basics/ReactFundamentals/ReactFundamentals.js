          <Text12>
            Components are the building blocks of React Native applications.
            They are reusable and encapsulate a piece of UI that can be composed
            and reused throughout the application. The rest of this introduction
            to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
            that need names and a cafe to work in. Here is your very first Cat
            component:

          <Text28>{'\n'}JSX (JavaScript XML):</Text28>
          <Text12>
            JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to
            write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is commonly used in React
            and React Native for building user interfaces. JSX makes it easier
            to write and understand the structure of UI components.

          <CopyAbleText
            content={`import React from 'react';
            import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
            
            const MyComponent = () => {
              return (
                <View>
                  <Text>Hello, World!</Text>
                </View>

          {/* PROPS */}
          <Text28>{'\n'}Props (Properties):</Text28>
          <Text12>
            Props are inputs to React components. They allow components to
            receive data from their parent components. Props are immutable and
            are passed down from parent to child components.
          </Text12>

          <CopyAbleText
            content={`import React from 'react';
            import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
            
            const Greeting = (props) => {
              return (
                <View>
                  <Text>Hello, {props.name}!</Text>
                </View>
              );
            };
            
            const App = () => {
              return (
                <View>
                  <Greeting name="Alice" />
                  <Greeting name="Bob" />
                  <Greeting name="Charlie" />
                </View>
              );
            };
            
            export default App;
            `}
          />

          {/* STATES */}
          <Text28>{'\n'}State:</Text28>
          <Text12>
            States are used to manage component-specific data that may change
            over time. Unlike props, states are mutable and can be updated using
            the setState method. Changes to a component's state trigger a
            re-render of the component.
          </Text12>

          <CopyAbleText
            content={`import React, { useState } from 'react';
            import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
            
            const Counter = () => {
              const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
            
              const increment = () => {
                setCount(count + 1);
              };
            
              return (
                <View>
                  <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
                  <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />

              );
