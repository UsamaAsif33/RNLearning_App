          <Text12>
            Syntax transformers make writing code more enjoyable by allowing you
            to use new JavaScript syntax without having to wait for support on
            all interpreters. React Native ships with the Babel JavaScript
            compiler. Check

            Syntax transformers, enabled via Babel, allow using modern
            JavaScript syntax. React Native's enabled transformations include
            ECMAScript 5-13 features and miscellaneous polyfills for browser and
            ES6/7/8/9/10/11/13 environments. Common transformations include
            arrow functions, classes, destructuring, async functions, dynamic
            imports, and more. Additionally, polyfills for standard functions
            like Array.from, Object.assign, and XMLHttpRequest are available
            across environments.
