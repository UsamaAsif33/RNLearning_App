            React Native is not only for Android and iOS devices - our partners
            and the community maintain projects that bring React Native to other
            platforms, such as:

          <Text18>Creating your own React Native platform</Text18>
          <Text12>
            Right now the process of creating a React Native platform from
            scratch is not very well documented - one of the goals of the
            upcoming re-architecture (Fabric) is to make maintaining a platform
            easier.
          </Text12>

          <Text18>Bundling</Text18>
          <Text12>
            As of React Native 0.57 you can now register your React Native
            platform with React Native's JavaScript bundler, Metro. This means
            you can pass --platform example to npx react-native bundle, and it
            will look for JavaScript files with the .example.js suffix. To
            register your platform with RNPM, your module's name must match one
            of these patterns:
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· react-native-example - It will search all top-level modules
            that start with react-native-
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· @org/react-native-example - It will search for modules that
            start with react-native- under any scope
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· @react-native-example/module - It will search in all
            modules under scopes with names starting with @react-native- You
            must also have an entry in your package.json like this:
          </Text12>

          <CopyAbleText
            content={`{\n"rnpm": {\n"haste": {\n"providesModuleNodeModules": ["react-native-example"],\n"platforms": ["example"]\n}\n}\n}`}
          />
          <Text12>
            "providesModuleNodeModules" is an array of modules that will get
            added to the Haste module search path, and "platforms" is an array
            of platform suffixes that will be added as valid platforms.
          </Text12>

      </ScrollView>
