                  {'\n'}ðŸ”· General support for tvOS: Apple TV specific changes
                  in native code are all wrapped by the TARGET_OS_TV define.
                  These include changes to suppress APIs that are not supported
                  on tvOS (e.g. web views, sliders, switches, status bar, etc.),
                  and changes to support user input from the TV remote or
                  keyboard.
                  {'\n'}
                  {'\n'}ðŸ”· Common codebase: Since tvOS and iOS share most
                  Objective-C and JavaScript code in common, most documentation
                  for iOS applies equally to tvOS.

                  TV, the native view class is RCTTVView, which has additional
                  methods to make use of the tvOS focus engine. The Touchable
                  mixin has code added to detect focus changes and use existing
                  methods to style the components properly and initiate the
                  proper actions when the view is selected using the TV remote,
                  so TouchableWithoutFeedback, TouchableHighlight and
                  TouchableOpacity will work as expected. In particular:

                  actually selected by pressing the "select" button on the TV

                  {'\n'}
                  {'\n'}ðŸ”· TV remote/keyboard input: A new native class,
                  RCTTVRemoteHandler, sets up gesture recognizers for TV remote
                  events. When TV remote events occur, this class fires
                  notifications that are picked up by
                  RCTTVNavigationEventEmitter (a subclass of RCTEventEmitter),
                  that fires a JS event. This event will be picked up by
                  instances of the TVEventHandler JavaScript object. Application
                  code that needs to implement custom handling of TV remote
                  events can create an instance of TVEventHandler and listen for
                  these events, as in the following code:
