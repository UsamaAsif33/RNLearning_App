            Fast Refresh is a React Native feature that provides near-instant
            feedback for changes in React components. It's enabled by default
            and can be toggled in the React Native Dev Menu.

            {'\n'}ðŸ”· Fast Refresh updates only the edited module, re-rendering
            the React component if applicable.
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· For modules with non-React exports, it updates both the
            edited module and its importers.
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· If the edited file is imported outside the React tree, Fast
            Refresh does a full reload.

            {'\n'}
            {'\n'}Syntax errors can be fixed during Fast Refresh sessions,
            removing redboxes. Modules with syntax errors don't run, eliminating
            the need for app reload.
            {'\n'}Runtime errors during module initialization are handled; the
            session continues once errors are fixed.
            {'\n'}Similarly, if a runtime error occurs within a component, the
            session continues after correction, with React remounting the app.
            {'\n'}Error boundaries help in gracefully handling errors in
            production, retrying rendering after redboxes on subsequent edits.
            They should be designed intentionally, avoiding excessive
            granularity.

            Fast Refresh endeavors to retain local React state in the edited
            component, but certain conditions may cause state reset:
            {'\n'}
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· Class components do not preserve state; only function
            components and Hooks do.
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· Additional exports alongside the React component in the
            edited module may lead to state resetting.
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· If a higher-order component like
            createNavigationContainer(MyScreen) is exported, and the returned
            component is a class, state resets.
            {'\n'}
            {'\n'}In the longer term, as more of your codebase moves to function
            components and Hooks, you can expect state to be preserved in more
            cases.

            {'\n'}
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function
            components (and Hooks) by default.
            {'\n'}ðŸ”· Sometimes you might want to force the state to be reset,
            and a component to be remounted. For example, this can be handy if
            you're tweaking an animation that only happens on mount. To do this,
            you can add // @refresh reset anywhere in the file you're editing.
            This directive is local to the file, and instructs Fast Refresh to
            remount components defined in that file on every edit.

            Fast Refresh in React attempts to preserve component state between
            edits.
            {'\n'}useState and useRef Hooks maintain their previous values
            unless their arguments or order of calls change.
            {'\n'}Hooks with dependencies like useEffect always update during
            Fast Refresh, ignoring their dependency lists.
            {'\n'}This ensures that edits reflect accurately on the screen, even
            if dependencies remain unchanged.
            {'\n'}Despite potential unexpected outcomes, it's advisable to write
            resilient code to facilitate the introduction of new dependencies,
            even without Fast Refresh.
